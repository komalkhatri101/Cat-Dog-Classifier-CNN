# Cat-Dog-Classifier-CNN
This repository contains the implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of cats and dogs. The project demonstrates data preprocessing, CNN architecture design, and model training using TensorFlow and Keras. It also includes functionality for making single predictions on new images.
